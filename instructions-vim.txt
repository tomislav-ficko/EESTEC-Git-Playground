Moving through the text can be achieved in two ways, either using the arrow buttons, or by pressing h, j, k and l button.
The reason for the latter combination being that the keys are easily reachable when typing, there is no need to move your hands.

h - move left
j - move down
k - move up
l - move right

w - move foreward to the next word
b - move backwards to the previous word
{ - move to upper paragraph
} - move to lower paragraph
gg - move to top of file
G - move to bottom of file

i - insert (before the currently selected character)
I - move to the beginning of the line and insert
a - append (after the currently selected character)
A - move to the end of the line and append
o - add a new line under the current line and insert
O - add a new line before the current line and insert

u - undo
ctrl+r - redo
d_ - delete character or line defined by the additional character (_ is h, j, k or l)
dd - delete the entire current line
dw - delete next word
db - delete previous word
di_ - "delete in" command (deletes everything contained inside the surrounding character and its pair, e.g. _ can be (, ', ", etc.)

y - copy
yy - copy entire line
p - paste
yw - copy next word
yb - copy previous word

f_ - find the next instance of the given char (e.g. _ can be fd, for finding the next d)

Commands:
:q - quit
:w - write (save)
:w filename.extension - write to new file named "filename.extension"
:wq - write and quit
:number - move to line "number"
:earlier _ - revert changes made in last given period (e.g. _ can be 3 minutes)
